The agile philosophy highlights the importance of customer-centric product development practices over product-centric approaches. While contracts will always have their place in business, a list of the things you’re offering your customer is no replacement for actually communicating with them about what their needs are and where their challenges are.

Traditional product-centric processes allowed contracts to dictate what was delivered in the end, which left a lot of room for mismatched expectations. The agile philosophy (and many of the formalized processes that have come out of it) encourage building a continuous customer feedback loop into development cycles.

Under the agile philosophy, customer collaboration begins early in the development process and happens frequently throughout. This culture of close collaboration with real customers helps product people ensure they’re delivering effective, useful solutions to customers. When you talk to customers often and build feedback into your development process, you reduce risk and eliminate guesswork.
