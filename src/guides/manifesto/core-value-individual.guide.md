No matter how well-researched your process and high-tech your tools are, it’s the team you work with and the way you work together that determines success. Your team and their ability to communicate effectively and efficiently is more valuable than the processes they follow or the tools you use.

This isn’t to say that agile philosophies discourage formalized processes or tools. Both can be helpful in providing structure for your team and facilitating interactions. But at the end of the day, they come second.

After all, processes and tools are worthless if your team can’t communicate. But put a smart, motivated team up to a task without any processes or tools to manage the project and chances are they’ll find some way to get it done.
